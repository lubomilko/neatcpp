# Introduction

**Pycpp** (**Py**thon **C** **p**re**p**rocessor) is a C code preprocessor written in Python. The preprocessor is not
intended to create source files for the compiler. It is aimed at the creation of C source files with correctly
expanded macros for the purposes of static analysis or code coverage analysis.

The **pycpp** produces a code with formatting very close to the original code, i.e., the line endings, intendantion and
comments are preserved, even in the expanded macro bodies. It is also possible to keep the original preprocessor
directives.

# Usage

## Pycpp as a Python module

```

## Pycpp as a standalone script
